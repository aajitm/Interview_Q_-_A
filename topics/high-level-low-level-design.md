## High-Level Design (HLD) Vs. Low-Level Design (LLD)

## High-Level Design (HLD)

### 1.Definition
High-Level Design (HLD) is the architectural blueprint of a software system that describes the structure and organization of the system at a high abstraction level. It focuses on the overall system design, major components, and their interactions.

### 2.Key Components
* Modules
* Interfaces
* Data flow
* System architecture

### 3.Example
In a C# application, a high-level design might define the main modules, their responsibilities, and the overall flow of data between different components. For example, in an e-commerce application, HLD may outline modules for user authentication, product catalog, and payment processing.


## Low-Level Design (LLD)

### 1.Definition
Low-Level Design (LLD) is a detailed design document that translates the high-level design into a more detailed blueprint. It provides specifics on how each component of the system will function and interact at a lower level of abstraction.

### 2.Key Elements
* Classes and methods
* Data structures
* Algorithms
* Database schema

### 3.Example
For a C# application, low-level design may involve defining classes and methods for each module identified in the high-level design. In the e-commerce example, LLD might specify the classes for UserAuthentication, ProductCatalog, and PaymentProcessing, along with their respective methods and interactions.
